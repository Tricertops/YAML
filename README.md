YAML for Objective-C and Swift
=============================

###### Hobby project in development…

Attempt to bring YAML serialization to Objective-C and Swift. Using official YAML C++ library bridged to Objective-C using framework.

Roadmap includes:

  - `YAMLSerialization` for simple structures, similar to `NSJSONSerialization`.
  - `YAMLKeyedArchiver` for `NSCoding` which would make use of YAML anchors.
  - `YAMLDocument` and `YAMLNode` for direct manipulation, similar to `NSXMLDocument`.
